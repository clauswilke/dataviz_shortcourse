First, I will discuss how to engage your audience by telling a story. Second, I will provide high-level guidance for designing visualizations that make a clear point. Third, I will describe key design principles that ensure your figures will be readable by people with vision impairments, and specifically impairments of color perception.\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides\nFrom Data to Visualisation 1\nVisualizing amounts; visualizing distributions; visualizing associations and trends\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides\nFrom Data to Visualisation 2\nVisualizing uncertainty; visualizing geospatial data\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides\nPrinciples of Figure Design\nColors; compound figures; infographics\n\nMaterials:\n\nSlides\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
